## Intro
This repo is supposed to host React components powered by JSON-LD and WordLift (a WordPress plugin).

## Usage
This repo is based on ES6, Webpack and React, in version 0.8 I am using Radium to manage styles and responsiveness.
<br>
I use a bomb-proof foundation provided by the [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate) by [mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr).

### Commands
To make it work you have to run:

```
npm install
```

For development environment run – provide compiling on the fly:

```
npm start
```

For a blazer fast production environment run:

```
npm run build
```

For a more detailed list of the commands available refer to the boilerplate docs at <https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate>
